# Stock-Analysis

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to show how VBA is used to create macro's for an Excel document with stock data that has highs, lows, close, and volume. We used the data from these sheets in Excel and used the provided VBA client to create our own sheet to calculate the total daily volume and the return on these stock options. In this project we used a refractored method which means to create a single **Sub()** to and have all the code neatly run togeather instead of making various different **Sub()** to have the code run this macro.
## Results
The results of the differences between the stocks return in 2017 and 2018 are staggering, in 2017 the retrun off all the stock options were up with the exception of TERP which was down -7.2%, and with multiple stock option up over 100%.
### 2017 Stock Options over 100%
> - DQ : 199.4%
> - ENPH : 129.5%
> - FSLR : 101.3%
> - SEDG : 184.5%
